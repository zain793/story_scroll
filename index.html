    const questions = [
      { title: "What is Story Protocol", desc: " Story Protocol is a blockchain focused on Making something again in a new way. How Intellectual property (IP) like art, stories, AI models, characters is managed, licensed, and monetized. Story Protocol is a blockchain for owning and monetizing creative work." },
      { title: "On-Chain Creative Assets", desc: "Art, stories, characters and AI models become registered IP assets. This gives them a digital identity that can be remixed and monetized." },
      { title: "Programmable IP Licensing", desc: "Creators set rules through PILs to control how others can use their work. The license works automatically both onchain and in realworld scenarios." },
      { title: "Automatic Royalty Distribution", desc: "Payments flow instantly to creators when their IP is used. Smart contracts remove the need for manual tracking or intermediaries." },
      { title: "Clear AI Data Ownership", desc: "AI developers can see exactly who owns the data or models they use. This reduces risk and makes AI training more transparent." },
      { title: "Protected Remix Culture", desc: "Story enables remixing while keeping contributions tracked. Everyone gets proper credit and fair revenue sharing." },
      { title: "Reduced Legal Complexity", desc: "Smart contracts automate licensing and minimize disputes. This cuts legal costs and makes collaboration smoother." },
      { title: "$IP Token Utility", desc: "$IP is used for all core actions on Story Protocol. Without $IP no registration, licensing or royalty execution can happen." },
      { title: "Transaction Gas Payments", desc: "Any interaction with the IP core requires $IP as gas. Registering assets, minting licenses or splitting royalties all use it." },
      { title: "Proof of Stake Security", desc: "Validators stake $IP to secure the network. This ensures decentralized trust and stable performance." },
      { title: "Validator Reward System", desc: "Validators earn more $IP for processing transactions. Their staking helps maintain consistency and network safety." },
      { title: "Ecosystem Contributor Rewards", desc: "Users who help verify content or build tools receive $IP. This keeps the ecosystem active and community driven." },
      { title: "Token Based Governance", desc: "$IP holders will participate in protocol decision making. Future upgrades and rules will be shaped by the community." },
      { title: "Creator IP Registration", desc: "Workflow begins when a creator uploads and registers their work. They may also open an IP Account to manage ownership and royalties." },
      { title: "Usage Based Fee Flow", desc: "Anyone using the IP pays fees in $I, which triggers automatic royalties. Validators and attestors verifying these actions also earn $IP." }
